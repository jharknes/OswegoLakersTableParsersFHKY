# OswegoLakersTableParsersFHKY

This parser will also work with the previous and later years that include home and away games. 
The year and file name would need to be updated. 

If I were to remake the parser tables, I would have created methods for ease of trouble shooting and reading.
Also, I would have created prompts to enter the years and file names that way the same exact program could be 
used instead of making minor changes for different years.
